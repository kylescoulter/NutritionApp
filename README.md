## About Nutrition Navigator
Nutrition Navigator will aim to include a recipe builder or analyzer which will let you input various ingredients to create your own recipes. It will let you upload items to the list of ingredients which will be only for that user, as well as use an API from usda.gov to look up common ingredients. In addition to that, the app will let you use recipes or raw ingredients to calculate the number of calories youâ€™ve had in a day and track your history.
